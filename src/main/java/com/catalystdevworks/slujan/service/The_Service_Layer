/*
 * Note: Services performs a discretely invokable logical
 * operations between your objects and an external objects or parts of the
 * application, making the logic unsuitable for encapsulation within the
 * object's class itself.
 * 
 * Generally the DAO is as light as possible and exists solely to provide a
 * connection to the DB, sometimes abstracted so different DB backends can
 * be used. The service layer is there to provide logic to operate on the data sent to
 * and from the DAO and the client.
 *
 * JPARepository is a good universal implementation of the DAO; you may in
 * practice sometimes only need to write the service layer.
